                    <h1> <strong>GUILT IS MUST!!!</strong> </h1>
                    <p>  "I don't want to forgive myself. That's why I hate psychoanalysis I think if you're guilty of something you should live with it. Get rid of it - how can you get rid of real guilt? I think people should live with it, face up to it."  - Orsan Welles, Orson Welles Quotes Ok, let me tell you a short story to understand this better. So this story is about a young guy, Abhishek. Abhishek thinks he is always right about everything. He concludes without any insight thinking he is always right and when he fails in something, he continues to give an opinion about other things without any feeling of guilt about his past experiences. I just have one word for such people: “Asshole”. Yes, Asshole describes you the best because how can you continue giving opinions about other things without any insight and considering you have already failed. This continued throughout all his college life and when the time of placement arrived, Abhishek went to give an interview for the job but as expected, he failed. He gave 13 interviews and failed, but was still not ready to accept that he is guilty of what has happened. He thinks maybe he is not made for a job, he is an entrepreneur instead. He takes a loan from bank invested it on some shitty idea without even thinking because of his same perspective: He is always right. His business idea failed and was left with a debt to be paid. Now, he started to feel guilty but its already too late. He decided to give up on his life and committed suicide. Feeling of guilt is very important for improvement. You can’t improve in any field of life if you don’t have a feeling of guilt when you fail in anything. It may seem that I am an idiot and this is all nonsense. Asif, don’t you know guilt affects our mental health. How can you say to have a feeling of guilt? Ok, yes a large amount of guilt affects your mental health and forces you to do some uncertain things such as suicide as we have seen in the case of Abhishek. But a small and good amount of guilt is so important in our life for improvement. If we have a feeling of guilt about a bad experience and we try to learn from it we will perform better in that field of life. Try to learn from your guilty experiences and always try to evolve!!!    </p>
